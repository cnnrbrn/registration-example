# Recipe example

This is my idea of a presentation, a README file.

## Main Recipe

Registration form

## Sub-recipes

Short videos for the concepts in the main recipe.

E.g:

- [creating a router from location.pathname](js/index.js)
- [getting all form inputs using formData](js/listeners/auth/registerListener.js)
- [creating a function that only makes an api call or throws an error](js/api/auth/register.js)
- [creating a reusable function to display any kid of message in the UI](js/ui/common/displayMessage.js)
- [catching errors and displaying them in the UI](js/listeners/auth/registerListener.js)
- etc

## Final video

All concepts from the above combined. Code from the videos have their own repos and are provided to the students.
